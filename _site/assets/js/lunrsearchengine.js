    "body": "2022/02/13 -  Located at the tip of point dume, separating westward beach and big / little dume the point dume reserve offers breath taking ocean and mountain views from bluffs above some of souther california’s more remote beaches. The hike starts at a small parking lot off cliffside drive. I recommend parking further away off dume drive since there are only limited spots. Also they enforce parking tickets and after sunset you will get a ticket which is no bueno. You do want to see the sunset right? Take the path heading to your left and stay to your left. You will see a view of little dume beach and follow a narrow trail to your left that goes along the cliffs. Once you get to the cliffs take new stair case if it open otherwise follow trail to right. This will take you down a path where you will find ropes to help you get down to little dume via the “death stairs”. Once at the beach you can explore some tide pools and walk along the beach. Little dume was for a long time more inaccessible to public and considered a private beach. Above the high tide line is still private but below high tide line is considered public so please respect the local residents. From here go back the way you came and when you are back on the cliffs continue to your left. Once you are at the top you will see views of catalina island, big dume and zuma beach. On a really clear day you can also see anacapa and sanat Cruz islands which are part of the channel islands. In front of the point dume state park monument is a narrow path that leads down to trail which wraps around the point. If you look to you left and below you can see a beach cove which is called secret beach or pirates cove (it is accessible via westward beach). The trail will split go to your left. This will take you down to westward beach. If you timed it right it should be close to sunset. There is a restaurant called the sunset which is a local spot, the food isn’t great but they make great drinks. When you are done head back up the way you came and once you reach a fork go left. This will take you back to cliffside drive where you started from. Head to your left on bird view drive and make a right on sea lion place. Finally a left on dume drive and you are back at your car. 1234Activity: HikingDuration: 2 hoursDifficulty: EasyBring: Good shoes, beach clothing, hat, water and snacks"

    "body": "2021/05/27 -  Located in the point mugu state park, this is an out and back with a loop around the majestic point mugu peak. Towering 1,266 ft above the pacific point mugu peak offers panoramic views of the coastline and channel islands. On a clear day you can see Catalina, San Nicholas, Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands. Point mugu peak is so close to the coastline you feel like you are flying above the ocean, it is truly an amazing out of body experience. The hike starts at a dirt parking lot and the trail is called the chumash trail. The trail has a very steep ascend, if you aren’t used to hiking you will want to go slow and take a lot of breaks. I would also avoid this hike on a hot day, there is no shade. As you ascend don’t forget to turn around you will be treated with a great view ocean view, the mugu wetlands and in the distance channel islands (on a clear day). After about 45 minutes you will reach the base of point mugu peak and a fork in the road. Go to your left and a few hundred feet down road go right and take the single track switch back up point mugu peak. Once you make it up the first part your are almost there and in the home stretch. From here you have an amazing view of point mugu in the distance.  If you come during spring you can see the cactus flowers bluming. Finally it is time to celebrate and enjoy a snack with quite a spectacular view. The peak is very flat and to the right is a nice little bench. North view on to anacapa, santa cruz islands and point mugu. South view of sandy dunes in the distance. East view of sandstone peak Once you are ready to head back continue on the trail south.  After 5-10 minutes you get to another fork, go to your right. You will soon pass by what I think is the best view. A smal trail to the left goes to an amazing lookout by some rocks. After joining back with main trail you will continue to traverse, I find this part the most amazing as you are looking out over the ocean the entire time. After another 15-20 minutes on the trail you will make it back to the first fork, continue left down to the parking lot. 1234Activity: HikingDuration: 3 hoursDifficulty: HardBring: Hiking boots, hat, water and snacks"

Countless movies and TV series were filmed in the park such as planet of the apes, the original tarzan and of course mash. This hike starts at grasslands trailhead on mullholland hwy where it meets malibu canyon. You can park on the side of the road on mullholland hwy. This is a very easy hike which is mostly flat. It is an out and back. Once on the trail you will get to a small hill that heads to the right. At the top of the hill 10 minutes from trailhead the trail will fork, take the middle trail which goes down into the main park area. You should see the beuatiful malibu creek in front of you. As you go down look to your right at a truly awe inspiring california oak. The hillside to the left on the other side of the creek is where planet of the apes was filmed by the rocky areas.  Once you reach the bottom you will join Crags road, go to your right. After another 10-15 minutes you will reach the main area and another fork, continue on Crags rd to your right which will go up a small incline. After another 10-15 minutes you will reach century dam. At the top of the incline you will see a small path going to your left which goes down to century dam. This is a great spot for a quick snack and to admire the tranqulity. Continue down the path which after 5 minutes will meet up with crags road. Conitnue down crags road and in about 20 minutes you will need to cross the malibu creek. There is a large log that you need to balance across. It is possible to fall into the creek (don’t worry it is shallow) but bring a towel and some extra socks. After crossing the creek you are almost there, it should be another 20 minutes to the mash site. The first vehicle is a replica which was recently added. A little further is the main area. There are picnic benches and of course an original mash jeep as well as a medic.  If you go during spring you will see lots of California poppy’s and other wild flowers blooming everywhere. On your way back once passed century dam and down the incline go straight. This will take you to the park visitor center. This property used to be owned by paramont studios and was used for lodging as well as entertaining. Even Mariyln Monroe stayed there so it is definitely worth checking out! 1234Activity: HikingDuration: 3 hoursDifficulty: EasyBring: Hiking boots, towel, extra socks, water and snacks"

    "body": "2021/04/12 -  Sandstone peak is the highest mountain in the santa monica mountains at 3,111 ft. The trailhead starts around 2,000 ft. It is about a 1,111 ft up elevation gain. The trail is an out and back but you can make a longer loop to extend your tour. The hike has very limited shade so it isn’t recommended when it is too hot. The trail will ascend very quickly. The first part is the most challenging but then it gets more gradual. Enjoy some breathtaking views of the santa monica mountains and rugged costaline. About 30 minutes into the trail to your right is Malibu lake which is a very secluded area off mullholand hwy and home to many famous people that are low key. On a clear day you will get a great view of catalina island jolting out of the pacific. The last part of the hike is a single track scamper up to the peak. If you want to go to highest point some bouldering is required, nothing crazy but be careful. The views at the highest perch in the santa monica mountains are breathtaking. You feel like an eagle on top of the world, soaring. 1234Activity: HikingDuration: 3 hoursDifficulty: ModerateBring: Hiking boots, water and snacks"
